# Draft for ML with Convex Hulls paper

ICML: February 2nd

Possible *Tracks*: Unsupervised learning/Autoencoders



# Paper itself

## Introduction

We focus on reconstruction error, autoencoding models

### Related work (maybe)

* Support vector machines
* Convex Hull Data Descriptor
* Deep Anomaly Detection

## Background on convex polytopes

(some preliminary information about convex geometry)

Primal-dual methods

## Methods

* Provide description: Dual bounding polytope, Scaling distance
* Mention: LeNet architecture with with batch normalization; parameters in the appendix.

Questions:

* How sensitive is DBP to data augmentation? Rotation

### Theoretical analysis for artificial datasets

## Experiments

Just meat here, everything else goes to appendix.

* MNIST
* FashionMNIST
* CIFAR-10
* MVTec

## Conclusion & Future work
